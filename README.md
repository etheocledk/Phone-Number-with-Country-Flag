Phone numbers are standardized in an international format known as E.164, which combines country codes and subscriber numbers in a format like this: +12345678900. This format is required by many APIs (including Twilio's) and means that you don't have to store country codes and phone numbers in two separate database columns.

To simplify the user experience, you can provide a phone number input field with country code and flag using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. Below is a reusable code snippet that allows users to input their phone number without needing to type the + sign and country code. Feel free to copy and customize the code as needed.
